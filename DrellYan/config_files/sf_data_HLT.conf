# Data or MC? Use DATA and MC keywords.
DATA
# Which efficiency? Options: HLT for this script to match file name (ID also possible)
HLT
# How to measure efficiencies? COUNTnCOUNT, COUNTnFIT, FITnFIT for pass/fail samples
# Note: for template-based fit of the data for ID efficiency, use FITnFIT only
# Note: for HLT efficiencies both data and MC are sufficiently background free
#   for using count and count method
COUNTnCOUNT
