Changes on 2012 Jan 19 by AndriusJ


Include/

cmp.sh: new
	Committed cmp.sh script that helps to compare two versions of the same
	file. Invokes diff for the files located in specified directory and 
	current directory. Usage
	   ./cmp.sh otherDir/filename [-r]
	The flag '-r' reverses the comparison order


EtaEtaMass.h
	An extended version that includes the event weight info


ElectronEnergyScale.hh
ElectronEnergyScale.cc
	An intermediate update that allows access to a file with constants

	Retired calibration sets: Date20120101_Gauss_6bins,
		Date20120101_Gauss_6binNegs. Still accessible via
		constructor(TString), once the constant files are provided 
		(will come with the next update)

	New calibration sets: 
	   Date20120101_default:  uses built-in default values for the 2012 
		full set. Not fully correct at the moment
	   CalSet_File_Gauss: has to be called via constructor(TString): 
		constructor("FileGauss <filename>")


MyTools.hh
	updated with a template function:
	   PrintVec(const char *msg, const vector<T> &vec)
