The fake background estimation is split into 3 parts:

1. Estimatng the fake rate and then applying the fake rate to data to obtain the fake distribution (fakeRate.cc). This distribution has real dielectrons in it, weighted by the fake rate. 
2. Taking the fake rate calculated in 1. and applying it to real dielectron MC events (DY->ee, DY->tautau ,ttbar, WW etc. ). (BgFakerate.cc)
3. The last step does all the plotting. Plot the distribution of 1.-2. ie the fake distribution - the dielectrons

To Run 1.
========

root -l
root [0] .L fakeRate.cc+
root [1] fakeRate()

In fakeRate.cc the JSON files are specified. fakeRate.cc runs over FakeDateSource.txt and DataFiles.txt which contains a list of datasets for the fake rate and the data respectiviely. Modify these files to point to where your ntuples are

To Run 2.
========

root -l
root [0] .L BgfakeRate.cc+
root [1] BgfakeRate()

BgFakeRate.cc read a file called BgfakeR.txt which is a list of files and cross sections for the MC events. You need to modify this file to point to where your ntuples are.

To Run 3.
========

> gmake
>./MakePlots

I compiled the code here to generate an executable to generate the plots. A 1D mass plot and rapidity plots in mass bins should be genenerated to name but a few.


To Dos
======

1. The json files are hardwired into the code for fakeRate.cc Would be nice to read a list of JSONs that can be modified instead
2. The list of files to be run over are hardwired in fakeRate.cc and BgfakeRate.cc. Need to change this so files can be specified
3. Need to be provide options for generating plots for the MakePlots executable.
