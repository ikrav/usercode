The fake background estimation is split into 3 parts:

1. Estimatng the fake rate and then applying the fake rate to data to obtain the fake distribution (fakeRate.cc). This distribution has real dielectrons in it, weighted by the fake rate. 
2. Takes the fake rate calculated in 1. and applies it to real dielectron MC events (DY->ee, DY->tautau ,ttbar, WW etc. ). (BgFakerate.cc). The calculates the contribution from weighting real di-electron events
3. The last step does all the plotting. Plots the distribution of 1.-2. ie the fake distribution - the dielectrons and plots the 1 and 2D distributions

To Run 1.
========

root -l
root [0] .L fakeRate.cc+
root [1] fakeRate()

In fakeRate.cc the JSON files are specified. fakeRate.cc runs over FakeDateSource.txt and DataFiles.txt which contains a list of datasets for the fake rate and the data respectiviely. Modify these files to point to where your ntuples are

To Run 2.
========

root -l
root [0] .L BgfakeRate.cc+
root [1] BgfakeRate()

BgFakeRate.cc read a file called BgfakeR.txt which is a list of files and cross sections for the MC events. You need to modify this file to point to where your ntuples are.

To Run 3.
========

> gmake
>./MakePlots

I compiled the code here to generate an executable to generate the plots. A 1D mass plot and rapidity plots in mass bins should be genenerated to name but a few.


To Dos
======

1. The json files are hardwired into the code for fakeRate.cc Would be nice to read a list of JSONs that can be modified instead. How ntuples and json files are specified could be done better and be more straighforward
2. The list of files to be run over are hardwired in fakeRate.cc and BgfakeRate.cc. Need to change this so files can be specified
3. Need to be provide options for generating plots for the MakePlots executable.
