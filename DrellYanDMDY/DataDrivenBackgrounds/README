#Setup environment

source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.4.3/x86_64-slc5/setup.csh
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.27.06/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt/root/bin/thisroot.csh


#generate reduced ntuples

root -l (shared libraries should compile if they have not already done so)  
root [0] .L selectEmuEvents.C+
root [1] selectEmuEvents("../config_files/data_emu.conf")

// You will have to edit data_emu.conf to point to your local ntuples
root [2].q 
//quit ROOT

#The ntuples should be output to a directory (../root_files/selected_events/DY_m10+pr+a05+o03+pr_4680pb/ntuples/EMU/)

#You also need to run selectEvents.C to generate reduced electron ntuples.These ntuples must contain two branches, mass (dilepton invariant mass) and weight

#run the EMU-METHOD

> cd eMuMethod
#compile code
> gmake eMuBkgExe
#This should produce the binary eMuBkgExe. There are many options to run it. See the the possible options below

./eMuBkgExe #run emu method for 1D analysis and produce plots
./eMuBkgExe --doDMDY #run 2D analysis and produce plots
./eMuBkgExe --doDMDY --saveRootFile #same as above but output ROOT file with yield, statistical and systematic info as true2eBkgDataPoints.root 

TODOs:
#####

* A lot of cleaning up of code
* Code uses a python config so you can make changes without having to recompile, ie change output/input directories. This does not work at CERN. Hence "gmake" fails. Need to run "gmake eMuBkgExe" to build only the C++ part
