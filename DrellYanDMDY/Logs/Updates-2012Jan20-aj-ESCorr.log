Updates on 2012 Jan 20 by AJ


Include/
     ElectronEnergyScale.hh
	  - commented out the desctructor which seem to cause trouble
	in some cases

     ElectronEnergyScale.cc
	  - fixed bug in the function DetermineCalibrationSet which caused 
	malfunction if the provided escaleTagName variable did not contain 
	a clean	entry. Now everything behind '#' is ignored
	  - The hard-coded calibration set "Date20120101_default" contains 
	values derived with a proper trigger set
	  - The file-based calibration sets Date20120101_Gauss_6bins and
	Date20120101_Gauss_6binNegs now have access to the files. Note that
	Date20120101_Gauss_6binNegs is actually Date20120101_default

root_files/constants 
	   contains new files
	testESF_6bins_Gauss_20120119.inp
	testESF_6binNegs_Gauss_20120119.inp

YieldsAndBackgrounds/
	prepareYields.C  -- corrected earlier introduced bug when any of 
	  the indices (mass or y) is out of range
