\subsection{Kansas State University}


The Kansas State University is one of the collaborating institutions for 
the PIRE and MRI grants
mentioned above and that provide funding for research and development on 
the CMS pixel detector upgrade. 
The KSU group has also recently received funding through NSF EPSCoR (NSF 
EPS-000561574 - 
``Towards New Discoveries at the Energy Frontier" (?) - Ivanov's First 
Award) that helped to support 
physics analyses activities at CDF and CMS: the $t\bar{t}$ cross section 
measurements and searches 
for up-type and down-type fourth generation quarks. 

The KSU high energy physics group receives most of its research support 
through the DOE HEP office.
Notable accomplishments over past three years include leadership in 
developing efficient methods 
for identifying electrons and photons (Maravin and post-doc Khalil), 
electroweak 
physics analyses (Bolton, Maravin, graduate students Chakaberia, 
Svintradze ), 
top physics and searches ( Ivanov, post-doc Khalil, graduate student 
Makouski).


KSU outreach activities include a 22-teacher QuarkNet center that serves 
small rural
Kansas schools, and an interdisciplinary program at KSU (Bolton) called 
the Center for Understanding of 
Origins that advances teaching and scholarship of  cosmology, evolutionary 
biology, and related 
siences.
