UNL is one of the collaborating institutions on the previously
mentioned PIRE and MRI grants which provided funding for students and
a postdoc and equipment to carry out research and development on pixel
detector upgrades as well as characterizations of the performance of
the current CMS pixel detector.  The UNL group of five
experimentalists also share a continuing base grant from the NSF
(numbers 0653592 and 0969704) which funded our activities on the DZERO
and CMS experiments including the search for and discovery Higgs boson
like particles, searches for evidence of supersymmetric particles and
measurements of the properties of the top quark.  At this time, our
analysis focus is on CMS and characterizations of the newly discovered
boson and the other electroweak vector bosons.  Bloom and Dominguez
also had NSF CAREER grants (0547780 and 0545593) prior to the base
grant above which funded our activites to build, install and operate
the CMS forward pixel detector and a Tier-2 computing facility.
