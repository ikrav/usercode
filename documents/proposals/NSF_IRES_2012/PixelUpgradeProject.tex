\section{CMS Pixel Detector Phase 1 upgrade project}

% This is just a starter that Alice contributed.
% It should be modified/expanded/etc as needed.

The CMS collaboration plans to upgrade the CMS pixel detector to
include a four-layer barrel and three endcap disks (on each end) with
improved data acquisition throughput. As the LHC luminosity increases
with more underlying events captured per beam crossing, the present
electronics readout system would incur significant dead time. A new
digital pixel readout chip (ROC) is being produced so that instead of
the 40 MHz analog readout, there will be a 400 Mbps digital
readout. This necessitates a re-design of the electronics downstream
from the silicon pixel modules. The upgraded detector also includes a
super light-weight mechanical design with CO2 cooling which will
significantly reduce the materials in the detector for better tracking
and vertexing performance. The full detector is expected to be
inserted in the CMS detector sometime in the 2017-2018 time
period. The CMS upgrade plan is described in \cite{UpgradeProposal}.
